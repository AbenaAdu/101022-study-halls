// let's do a reference error
//  L can we talk about things out of scope? that haven't been defined yet?

// let's divide by zero
//  L yeah we can't do that...

// let's do a type error -> call a method on undefined...
//  L first let's start with an array (of books maybe?)
//  L let's not find something and then call a method on it
//  L what is conditional chaining?

// for ALL of these -> what line is the error on? what happens if we can't do something?

// let's talk about return vs console.log...
